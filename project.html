            My eductional experience includes a 2years completed high school degree which contributed
            greatly to my litle skills in programing. i studied ict, biology, chemisty and maths in my high 
            school, going to the university i applied for computer but it was aproof but what i didnt like approfe for 
            me. so i dicided to drop out to study what i like, i dont so much have go knowlege when it comes to cumputer 
            cuz i studied it just for a year. during my secondry school level, my A.math teacher stoped me from 
            studing computer sciecne since i was good in maths usally clashes it computer. Both my ict background has
            prepared me well for this position and for a successful career path. i also plan to pursue further coursework
            inthe future in oder to keep learing and gain the qualiications to advance in this feild.

            Now aredays programing is one of the best paid jobs around,its important in our dayly
            lifs to enhance and increase the power of computers and the internet.
            i love it cuz it speeds up the input and output processes in a machine.
            it is important to automate, collect, manage, calculate, analyze the processing of data 
            and information accuratly.
